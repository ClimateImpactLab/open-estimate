[1] WC/DM refers to workers' compensation costs and disability management claims cost.
[2] For consistency, whole integers reported in the literature have been written as a decimal with an "x.0" and for cost benefit ratios an addition significant number has been added ("x.y0")
[3] An estimate of 56% for hospital costs as a portion of overall costs was made, and then applied to the overall observed change to derive the measure of 7.4%.
[4] The comparison provided is for external controls.
[5] This number is the average found with two of the three studies. The third study found no significant change.
[6] This study also examined offsetting pension costs, decreased life insurance costs, increased productivity and program revenue generation.
[7] Imputed from data provided in the study.
[8] Program also examined cardiac rehabilitation savings and savings from treadmill testing.
[9] Reductions were found in hourly employees only.
[10] Applying more rigorous statistical methods found that participants did not have a statistically sign ificant lower per capita cost, but the rate of cost growth for participants was 12% lower than non -participants
[11] This cost/benefit ratio was the highest of three different program intervention models.
[12] Averages values reported are simple mathematical means of the average reported effect size of each study. They do not reflect the sample size of each study.
