"""Diagnostic Manager for calculation results

The DiagnosticManager class manages calculation data for a diagnostic
file.  It is based around the following principles:

- Each DiagnosticManager manages one file of diagnostics.

- Each row in the diagnostic file is specific to a region and a year.

- As soon as all of the material for a given region-year combination
  is available, it should be written to the file and removed from
  memory.

- The number of columns for the file are not known until a region-year
  is complete, since diagnostics may come from any buried level of the
  calculation.

- There is typically only one calculation system in action at a time,
  and all results from these should be written to the same file.

A typical workflow is as follows:

```
import diagnostic

diagnostic.begin("my-calculation.csv")

# Set up the applications of the calculation
calculation = ...
applications = {region: calculation.apply(region) for region in regions}

for year in weather_years():
    for region in regions:
        for yearresult in applications[region].push(weather_data(region, year))
            # This yearresult may not correspond to the weather data year
            diagnostic.record(region, yearresult[0], "final-result", yearresult[1])

            # Do something with the yearresult
            ...

            diagnostic.finish(region, yearresult[0])

diagnostic.close()
```
