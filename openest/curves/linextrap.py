"""Curve definition that implements linear extrapolation clipping.

These Curve classes take a curve and represent it with a linear
extrapolation beyond certain bounds. Slopes for the linear
extrapolation are determined by the behavior of the curve within some
margin of the bounds.

Two options are available for representing bounds, and they imply
different logic for clipping. If the bounds are a (convex) polytope,
the extrapolation for a given point is determined by the orthogonal
vector from whatever facet it lies closest to. If that facet is
slanted, slopes will be applied to multiple dimensions. If the bounds
are given as a set of limits for each dimension, the extrapolation for
a given point is determined separately for each of its
dimensions. Only those dimensions that it lies beyond will be
adjusted.

class LinearExtrapolationCurve(UnivariateCurve):
    """Linear extrapolation clipping curve which takes a list of multidimensional points.

    Bounds can be described as a polytope (see options in
    bounding.py), or a dictionary of bounds (see above for difference
    in logic). In the latter case, the dictionary should have a key
    for each dimension that should be clipped. The values of the
    dictionary should be 2-tuples with the high and low bounds for
    that dimension.

    Margins should be provided for each dimension. These are allowed
    to be different by dimension, and should depend on the scale of
    the variable.

    The inputs should be a list of N x L, where L is the total number
    of variables. This may be smaller than the number of independent
    dimensions, if some of the variables are transformations of
    others. For example, a 4th order polynomial input would be applied
    to the curve as an N x 4, but only the first dimension in the
    independent variable. The `getindeps` function provides this
    translation, and in the polynomial case would return an N x 1
    matrix.

        Translates from the full variable matrix to just the independent variables.
