"""Functions to the detection of polytope boundaries.

The main functions here, `ray_tracing_inside` and
`within_convex_polytope` are used to determine if a list of points is
contained in a polytope (the K-dimensional generalization of a
polygon).

For fewer than 4 dimensions, arbitrary polygons are supported, using a
ray-tracing method. Otherwise, it is only supported to detect if a
point is within a set of bounds, represented by K-dimensional planes.

Multiple representations of polytopes are supported. For 1-D and 2-D,
a list of points can be used, with the convention that points proceed
clockwise. For up-to 3-D, the polytope can represented as a list of
facets, each of which is a K-1 polytope (e.g., a polygon for a
polyhedron). For any dimension, convex polytopes can also be
represented by planes characterized by a point and an outward-facing
vector.
