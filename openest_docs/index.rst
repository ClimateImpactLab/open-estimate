   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to openest's documentation!
===================================


This is where the introduction to our libraries will go. Ideally, this will be a
short overview of the library, with one or two very simple use cases. It will, hopefully, 
answer the question: 'Why should I use this tool?'



OpenEst is a library created by the `Climate Impact Lab`_ team.

This code is open source and available on `github`_.

.. _Climate Impact Lab: http://www.impactlab.org/
.. _github: https://github.com/ClimateImpactLab/open-estimate/tree/first-docs


We can add any additional information about the library here. Please make suggestions.
