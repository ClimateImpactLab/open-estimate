Crowd-Sourcing Model Aggregation Library

Installation
------------

This library depends on numpy and scipy.  In addition, to use Mean-Size hierarchical sampling, the emcee library must be installed.

```
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install emcee
```

Install the package by calling
```
python setup.py install
```
(or use `develop` rather than install if you'll be editing the code).
