Installation
------------

This library depends on numpy and scipy.  In addition, to use Mean-Size hierarchical sampling, the emcee library must be installed

If the source is available in the current working directory, install this package with::

    pip install .

or ``pip install . -e`` if you would like to edit the code locally.

You can install this package directly from its github repo with ``pip install git+https://github.com/ClimateImpactLab/open-estimate.git``

Full Documentation can be found `here <http://openest.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_.

``bottleneck`` is an optional dependency, improving the performance of some functions.
